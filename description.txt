Preprocessing:
Analyzing temporal dynamic of target -- there is a linear trend in prices, added as a new feature
Analyzing missing value distribution for macro and train/test dataset, correlations, other EDA related tasks
Using PCA on macro dataset and mapping PCs to train/test by dates
Imputing missing data on train/test with simple imputer
Running XGB to select top 50 features based on 'gain'
Running iterative imputer on the selected columns with random forest regressor for better imputation
Running XGB on selected features
